# cod-lfg - dead simple ranked Call of Duty party finder

Why doesn't this exist already? Are there that few people playing ranked cod multiplayer?

Anyways, use cod-lfg to post your info in the hopes of getting added to a group of ranked CoD players

I don't work for Activision, or any CoD company. I just want a way to find groups
